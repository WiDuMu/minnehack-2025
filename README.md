## Minnehistory:


*"To know the future, you must understand the past."*

Over the past decade, recognizing historical value in how communities have been represented has been essential to moving forward and changing for the better. By getting a better idea of how our cities and neighborhoods *used* to be structured, we can have a fuller perspective on the places we live in, and take pride in building the future we want to see in future generations! For this, we have a solution close to home: **MinneHistory**.

MinneHistory takes a modern-day GIS display and shows a stictched collection of *30* different maps from the 50s! With the map overlay, you can see prime areas where there have been *huge* transitions in urban planning and demographics of the different areas of Minneapolis. 

### With MinneHistory, you can explore what life *was*, and imagine what life could *be*.
